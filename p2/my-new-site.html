    <h2>West coast Alpha's</h2>

        <p> Chi Psi fraternity consists of 31 active Alpha's. With 5 Alpha's designated at the west coast. These five alpha's includes University of Washington, University of Oregon, Cal Berekely, University of Colorado Boulder, and Texas Tech.
        All five of our ALpha's are fairly close to one another. We usually get to see each other at national events such as our annual Rowe Region Conference, where each Alpha ends our five delegates to attend the conference. Along with that there is the national convention. Which is the annual event where all 31 alphas have people go there is always a couple hundred people at this event. I personally never got the opportunity to go but I've heard it was a <em><b>blast</b></em>

    <h2>Oregon Alpha</h2>
    <p>At the Oregon Alpha we have 24 active brothers along with 6 pledges. We were established in 1941, but were suspended in 2016. We never lost our charter though allowing my pledge class to be the refounding fathers. Last Janurary we were given the chance to go up to <strong> University of Washington </strong> and initiate that was  probably one of the best expieriences we got to have.</p>
